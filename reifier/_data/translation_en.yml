    Reifying concepts into physical objects that blend form, function and elegance is the goal  I do at Réifier.

    Crafting lasting pieces that blend form, function, and elegance is my true passion. As a woodworker, I believe that 
    every piece I create should tell a story, one that speaks to both the quality of craftsmanship and the timeless beauty
    of wood. Whether it’s a custom-made bookshelf, a handcrafted cabinet, or a unique home element, I approach each project
    with the goal of transforming an idea into something that will stand the test of time.

    My background is unconventional. I initially embarked on a career in academic research, earning a Ph.D. in participatory democracy at the University of Amsterdam. While my academic journey sharpened my analytical abilities and attention to detail, it was in woodworking where I truly found my calling. I’ve always been fascinated by how hands-on craftsmanship can bring ideas to life, and after years of reflecting on my future, I decided to follow my passion for design and woodwork. My thesis may not be about furniture, but the skills I developed—researching, problem-solving, and refining complex ideas—are what I bring to every project today.


    What drives me as a craftsman is my belief in creating pieces that are not only functional but enduring. I am committed to designing and building furniture that holds both aesthetic and practical value, ensuring it can be enjoyed for generations to come. I focus on using premium materials and meticulous techniques to craft bespoke furniture that integrates seamlessly into its environment. For me, every joint, finish, and detail matters, as I believe true craftsmanship is found in the smallest of details.


    I am constantly refining my skills through hands-on experience and formal training. Currently, I’m enrolled in a comprehensive furniture-making course to further enhance my craft. Each project is a new opportunity for growth, and I am always excited to challenge myself with new techniques and ideas. Whether working on a bespoke piece for a client or exploring new designs in my own workshop, my goal is to create work that isn’t just built—it's crafted with intention, passion, and precision.
