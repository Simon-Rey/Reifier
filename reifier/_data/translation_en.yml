      My journey to woodworking has been anything but conventional. I began in academic research, earning a Ph.D. in 
      participatory democracy at the University of Amsterdam. While this path honed my analytical thinking and meticulous
      attention to detail, it was in woodworking that I discovered my true passion. The hands-on nature of 
      craftsmanship—taking an idea and transforming it into something tangible and beautiful—has always captivated me.
      Though my doctoral thesis wasn't about furniture, the skills I developed through research, problem-solving,
      and refining complex ideas now form the foundation of every project I undertake.

      **Functionality by design.** Optimisation is my key obsession—I am always looking for the best way for something
      to serve its purpose. For me, furniture should be thoughtfully designed to be as functional as it is beautiful.
      A storage cabinet should make clever use of every centimeter, a chair should offer true comfort, and a stand should
      quietly do its job without drawing attention. The ideal piece of furniture is one that works perfectly for its
      purpose, without fuss or compromise.
      
      
      **Elegance in form.** Elegance, I believe, is what transforms the functional into something truly special. It can
      be found in the gentle curve of a design, the natural beauty of a wood grain, or the precision of a perfectly executed joint.
      Every piece I create is made with a focus on these details, ensuring even a simple shelf feels graceful and elegant.
      
      
      **Durability as baseline.**  Furniture should be built to last. This durability comes from robust, thoughtful designs
      and a careful selection of materials sourced responsibly. By choosing sustainable options, 
      I hope to craft furniture that not only endures but also respects the world it comes from.
