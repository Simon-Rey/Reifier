  title: About Réifier
  bio:
    header: Biography
    content: >
      My journey to woodworking has been anything but conventional. I began in academic research, earning a Ph.D. in 
      participatory democracy at the University of Amsterdam. While this path honed my analytical thinking and meticulous
      attention to detail, it was in woodworking that I discovered my true passion. The hands-on nature of 
      craftsmanship—taking an idea and transforming it into something tangible and beautiful—has always captivated me.
      Though my doctoral thesis wasn't about furniture, the skills I developed through research, problem-solving,
      and refining complex ideas now form the foundation of every project I undertake.

  work_ethics:
    header: Work Ethics
    content: >
      **Functionality by design.** Optimisation is my key obsession—I am always looking for the best way for something
      to serve its purpose. For me, furniture should be thoughtfully designed to be as functional as it is beautiful.
      A storage cabinet should make clever use of every centimeter, a chair should offer true comfort, and a stand should
      quietly do its job without drawing attention. The ideal piece of furniture is one that works perfectly for its
      purpose, without fuss or compromise.
      
      
      **Elegance in form.** Elegance, I believe, is what transforms the functional into something truly special. It can
      be found in the gentle curve of a design, the natural beauty of a wood grain, or the precision of a perfectly executed joint.
      Every piece I create is made with a focus on these details, ensuring even a simple shelf feels graceful and elegant.
      
      
      **Durability as baseline.**  Furniture should be built to last. This durability comes from robust, thoughtful designs
      and a careful selection of materials sourced responsibly. By choosing sustainable options, 
      I hope to craft furniture that not only endures but also respects the world it comes from.

  process:
    title: The Process
    consultation:
      title: Initial Consultation
      text: >
        Each project starts with a conversation: we discuss your needs, your preferences and any other specific requirement.
        Initial contact is typically done via email after which we can meet up around a tea.
    sketch:
      title: Concept & Sketching
      text: >
        The initial discussion will typically result in a few ideas. I will then create initial sketches and design concepts.
        We will then refine them together to make sure every detail is just right.
    material:
      title: Material Selection
      text: >
        While designing your piece, we will also discuss material. I will guide you through options that balance aesthetics,
        durability, and sustainability to achieve the perfect piece.
    crafting:
      title: Crafting
      text: >
        Crafting the piece can then begin. This happens in my workplace in Amsterdam Noord. If needed, I will work with external
        collaborators to perfectly cover all the aspects of your project
    delivery:
      title: Delivery & Installation
      text: >
        Once the piece is ready, we will arrange for delivery or pickup. If needed, I can also assist with installation.
  pricetime:
    title: Pricing and Timing
    pricing:
      title: Pricing
      text: >
        Each project is unique, and the cost depends on various factors such as material selection, size, and complexity.
        Because of this, it is not possible to provide fixed prices on the website. However, estimates can be offered
        at several steps as we discuss the design.
    timing:
      title: Timing
      text: >
        I always strive to complete projects as efficiently as possible while maintaining high-quality craftsmanship.
        The exact timeframe depends on my current workload and the complexity of the piece.
        Feel free to reach out to discuss your project, and I will give you an estimate of the expected timeline.
