  bio:
    header: Biography
    content: >
      My journey to woodworking has been anything but conventional. I began in academic research, earning a Ph.D. in 
      participatory democracy at the University of Amsterdam. While this path honed my analytical thinking and meticulous
      attention to detail, it was in woodworking that I discovered my true passion. The hands-on nature of 
      craftsmanship—taking an idea and transforming it into something tangible and beautiful—has always captivated me.
      Though my doctoral thesis wasn't about furniture, the skills I developed through research, problem-solving,
      and refining complex ideas now form the foundation of every project I undertake.

      **Functionality by design.** Optimisation is my key obsession—I am always looking for the best way for something
      to serve its purpose. For me, furniture should be thoughtfully designed to be as functional as it is beautiful.
      A storage cabinet should make clever use of every centimeter, a chair should offer true comfort, and a stand should
      quietly do its job without drawing attention. The ideal piece of furniture is one that works perfectly for its
      purpose, without fuss or compromise.
      
      
      **Elegance in form.** Elegance, I believe, is what transforms the functional into something truly special. It can
      be found in the gentle curve of a design, the natural beauty of a wood grain, or the precision of a perfectly executed joint.
      Every piece I create is made with a focus on these details, ensuring even a simple shelf feels graceful and elegant.
      
      
      **Durability as baseline.**  Furniture should be built to last. This durability comes from robust, thoughtful designs
      and a careful selection of materials sourced responsibly. By choosing sustainable options, 
      I hope to craft furniture that not only endures but also respects the world it comes from.

    consultation:
      title: Initial Consultation
      text: >
        Each project starts with a conversation: we discuss your needs, your preferences and any other specific requirement.
        Initial contact is typically done via email after which we can meet up around a tea.

        The initial discussion will typically result in a few ideas. I will then create initial sketches and design concepts.
        We will then refine them together to make sure every detail is just right.
    material:

        While designing your piece, we will also discuss material. I will guide you through options that balance aesthetics,
        durability, and sustainability to achieve the perfect piece.

kubus:
  description: >
    *Kubus* is a monolithic cube, precisely crafted, designed to serve as a side table, nightstand, or adaptable furniture piece.
    At first glance, it appears as a seamless, solid block; an exercise in pure geometric form. 
    Yet, hidden within its minimalist design lies a carefully engineered storage system.


    The top panel slides open to reveal a discreet compartment, perfect for storing your tea set for instance.
    Meanwhile, the bottom half houses a seamlessly integrated drawer, designed to maintain the cube’s uninterrupted 
    appearance when closed.


    Kubus is an exploration of elegance through restraint—where utility is embedded within the form itself, without 
    disrupting its purity.
