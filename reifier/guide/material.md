<h1>Wood Material Guide</h1>

Choosing the material for a project is always a difficult task. As furniture maker, I am used to work with very different
wood-based materials that all have their pros and cons. To help you with selecting a material for your project, here
is a little description of what we can work with.

<h2>Solid Wood</h2>

Solid wood refers to what is usually meant when we say "wood": lumber cut directly from trees that are then processed
into plank, balks, etc...

There exists thousands of species of trees, meaning thousands of different solid woods we can work with.

<h2>Panel Wood</h2>

Panel wood is not wood per-se, this term encompasses a large variety of products that are based on wood. Raw wood product
(trunks, small branches, dust, etc) is processed to create material that comes as panel sheets.

Different techniques, using different type of raw material leads to different end materials, each with their specificities.
